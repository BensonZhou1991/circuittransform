layer 10:(1 2 4 13 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 0 )
layer 11:(1 2 3 13 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 0 )

After mapping (no post mapping optimizations are conducted): 
  elementary gates: 75
  depth: 48

The mapping required 0.000184 seconds

Initial mapping of the logical qubits (q) to the physical qubits (Q) of the IBM QX5 architecture:
