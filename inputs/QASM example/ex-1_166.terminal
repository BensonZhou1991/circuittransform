Circuit name: ex-1_166.qasm (requires 16 qubits)

Before mapping: 
  elementary gates: 19
  depth: 12
layer 0:(1 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 )
layer 1:(1 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 )
layer 2:(1 15 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 0 )

layer 10:(15 0 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 2 )
layer 11:(15 0 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 2 )

After mapping (no post mapping optimizations are conducted): 
  elementary gates: 55
  depth: 36

The mapping required 0.000139 seconds

Initial mapping of the logical qubits (q) to the physical qubits (Q) of the IBM QX5 architecture: 
  q0 is initially mapped to Q1

  q7 is initially mapped to Q7
  q8 is initially mapped to Q8
  q9 is initially mapped to Q9
  q10 is initially mapped to Q10
  q11 is initially mapped to Q11
  q12 is initially mapped to Q12
  q13 is initially mapped to Q13
